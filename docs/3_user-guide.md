# User Guide

The User Guide is organized as a progression:

1. Start with a quick end-to-end probability workflow.
2. Choose your modeling path:
   - Direct distribution from chain (`ProbCurve.from_chain`, `ProbSurface.from_chain`)
   - Volatility-first (`VolCurve`/`VolSurface` then `implied_distribution()`)
3. Use API comparison and reference pages for exact method behavior.

If you are deciding between APIs, start with [API Comparison](user-guide/05_api_comparison.md).
