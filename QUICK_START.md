    current_price=None,               # auto-fetched spot
    expiry_date=date(2025, 12, 19),   # next option expiry you care about
    risk_free_rate=0.04,              # flat risk-free estimate
)

est = RND.from_ticker("AAPL", market)   # magic âœ¨

est.plot()                              # PDF + CDF in one line
print(est.prob_at_or_above(200))        # e.g. 0.075 â†’ 7.5 %
```

Thatâ€™s itâ€”no CSVs, no maths, no extra setup.
